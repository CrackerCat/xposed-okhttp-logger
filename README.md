# Xposed Logger Module for OkHttp
This is a simple module for the [Xposed Framework](https://xposed.info) that logs all HTTP(S) requests made via [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/).
Supports all applications which are not using advanced source code obfuscation techniques (name mangling as done by e.g. [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard) is fine).


# Building
Built with gradle and most recent version of Android SDK build tooks v29.0.0 (as of 2019/10).
To build, run the following command in the root directory of this repository:

`./gradlew build`

The generated APK is in `RequestLogger/build/outputs/apk/<buildtype>/`.
Once installed, it should show up as `RequestLogger` in the Xposed Installer.
The module's only dependency is Xposed Bridge.

Tested on an Android Oreo 8.0.0 virtual device (x86) with Xposed Framework v90-beta3.


# Internals

## Placing the Hooks
There are several points during the lifetime of a OkHttp request at which we can hook in order to log each HTTP(S) request:
 * Hook **`okhttp3.Request` constructor or `okhttp3.Request.Builder` methods**: might yield some false positives, since Request objects can be created without issuing an HTTP call. Further, `okhttp3.Request` objects can be (re)created several times by interceptors before the actual request is issued, leading to duplicates.
 * Hook **`okhttp3.OkHttpClient.newCall(Request r)`**: similar to above, but guarantees to log each request only once.
 * Hook **internal implementations of `okhttp3.Call.execute()` and `okhttp3.Call.enqueue(Callback c)` by `okhttp3.RealCall`**: logs all HTTP(s) requests only when they are scheduled to be executed. This also includes calls that were only scheduled but not executed because the app terminated before the call was issued.
 * Hook **`okhttp3.Response` constructor or `okhttp3.Builder` methods**: has the same effect as above option, but only logs when a request is finished (successfully or not). Further, similar to the first option, `okhttp3.Response` objects can be (re)created several times after a request has been issued, leading to duplicates.

This module implements the 3rd option, hooking `okhttp3.RealCall.execute()` and `okhttp3.RealCall.enqueue(Callback c)` since it yields the most accurate results and no duplicates.
It obtains the `okhttp3.Request` object from the issued call by reading the call's `originalRequest` field.
The URL of the request can then be read from the `url` field of the request object.

All detected requests are logged with timestamps in a logfile `_requests.log` in the private storage of each application.


## Overcoming name mangling obfuscation
This module also implements a crude heuristic to find the required classes and field/method names when all identifiers from the original source code have been replaced with random ones.
Specifically, this module is able to detect the standard name mangling scheme where each identifier is replaced with the shortest alphabetical string (in ascending order) such that no collusion occur.
The implemented deobfuscator can identify obfuscated OkHttp code as follows:

 1. Enumerate all classes and interfaces of the root `okhttp3` package by generating the class names until we find one Xposed cannot find.
 In the tested OkHttp versions this was the case at `okhttp.ae`.

 2. Identify the `okhttp3.Call` interface, depending on OkHttp version:

    * newer ones: based on its factory interface subclass and this class' only method, which accepts some `okhttp3.*` class as parameter and creates an `okhttp3.Call` object.
 In the same step we can also identify the `okhttp3.Request` class and the `Call.request()`getter.

    * old ones (< v2.7.1 from 01/2016):  based on signature of methods in the interface (taking one argument max, one method can throw an exception).
 The `okhttp3.Request` class will be resolved later in step 6 when we know the `okhttp3.RealCall` class.

 3. Find the `okhttp3.Call.execute()` and `okhttp3.Call.enqueue(Callback c)` methods among the methods in the `Call` interface based on their signature.

 4. Find the `okhttp3.RealCall` class, which should be the only class implementing the `okhttp3.Call` interface.

 5. Get the implementations of `execute()` and `enqueue(Callback c)` in `RealCall`, which have the same name as their abstract declaration in the `Call` interface.

 6. (Old versions of OkHttp only: Find the `okhttp3.Request` class based on the fact it has no superclass and the field types in the `RealCall` class).
 Then, find the `originalRequest` field of the `RealCall` class based on its type.

 7. Find the `okhttp3.HttpUrl` class based on one of its method's return type `java.net.URI`.
 No other class in the package uses this class. Given the `HttpUrl` class we can finally find the `url` field in `okhttp3.RealCall`.
 In order to reduce the number of classes we have to check, we can limit the search to all class types of the fields in `okhttp3.Request`.
 This means that we will only search `okhttp3.CacheControl`, `okhttp3.Headers`, `okhttp3.HttpUrl` and `okhttp3.RequestBody`.


# Tricking this module
After a `RealCall` instance is created from a `Request` object using `okhttp3.OkHttpClient.newCall(Request r)`, interceptors registered with the client are able to transform the call before it is sent on the network (see [Interceptors Documentation](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/docs/interceptors.md)).
This means that an interceptor could change the requested URL after a `RealCall` has been created and before the request is sent.
This could be abused to make this module log a different URL than the one which is actually requested.
The only way to prevent this is to inject a network interceptor after the last user-supplied network interceptor and before the [`okhttp3.internal.http.CallServerInterceptor`](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/eee838aebe8d3524d7e0e2dbf8f9bf357512f038/okhttp/src/main/java/okhttp3/internal/http/CallServerInterceptor.kt), which issues the actual request on the network. (see [relevant code, lines 176-197](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/16173e2af93fe69ac39787e0e5d22649ff264cff/okhttp/src/main/java/okhttp3/RealCall.kt#L176)).
Alternatively to injecting a network interceptor, one could also hook the `okhttp3.internal.http.RealInterceptorChain.proceed` methods to log the request when the `CallServerInterceptor` is detected.

If requests served from OkHttp's cache should be logged as well, one also needs to log requested URLs between the last user-supplied application interceptor and the OkHttp core.
